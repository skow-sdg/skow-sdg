About Me
ðŸ‘‹Howdy, I'm Colin Skow, a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and proud owner of a giant pet tortoise named Speedy. When I'm not testing software, you can find me hanging out with Speedy in the backyard, pretending to be a ninja while doing martial arts, or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Not really, though. Chat GPT created this for me.
